<h3> Why did you make this? </h3>
I like the look of <a href="https://ayashii.net/">ayashii.net</a> but think
it's just a little bit too clunky. There is also a severe lack of messageboards
that support tags. Also, my previous tagboard, <a href="//0chan.vip">multichan</a>
(0chan), which was intended to be decentralized, kind of fell apart because
decentralization and anonymity don't really work together.

<h3> Why can't I "sage" a thread? </h3>
This software is WIP.

<h3> Where can I download the source code? </h3>
<a href="//github.com/153/pohon2">github.com/153/pohon2</a>

<h3>Any helpful features I should know about?</h3>
From a tree or thread view, you can click on the post number of a comment to
either (a) reply to it, (b) see its parent comments in a convenient place, or
(c) switch views from tree to thread or thread to tree, anchored on that post.
<p>
Also, clicking the "@" in the header will always talk to you the frontpage of
this site, whereas clicking the name of the board (eg. Pohon BBS) lets you
navigate up one level of taxonomy; someone from <code>/tags/random</code> will
be returned to <code>/tags/</code>, etc
