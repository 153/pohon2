<h3>1.  Why did you make this? </h3>
<p>
I like the look of <a href="https://ayashii.net/">ayashii.net</a> but think
it's just a little bit too clunky. There is also a severe lack of messageboards
that support tags. Also, my previous tagboard, <a href="//0chan.vip">multichan</a>
(0chan), which was intended to be decentralized, kind of fell apart because
decentralization and anonymity don't really work together.

<h3>2. Why can't I "sage" a thread? </h3>
<p>
This software is WIP.

<h3>3. Why is SJIS so buggy? </h3>
<p>
See 2.

<h3>4. Where can I download the source code? </h3>
<p>
<a href="//github.com/153/pohon2">github: 153/pohon2</a>

<h3>5. Any helpful features I should know about?</h3>
<p>
From a tree or thread view, you can click on the post number of a comment to
either (a) reply to it, (b) see its parent comments in a convenient place, or
(c) switch views from tree to thread or thread to tree, anchored on that post.
<p>
Also, clicking the "@" in the header will always talk to you the frontpage of
this site, whereas clicking the name of the board (eg. Pohon BBS) lets you
navigate up one level of taxonomy; someone from <code>/tags/random</code> will
be returned to <code>/tags/</code>, etc

<h3>6. Why did my post get deleted?</h3>
<p>
Maybe you posted garbage! Don't do that!

<h3>7. What's this error message about my line being too long?</h3>
<p>
Most people are used to writing out long sentences on platforms such as Facebook,
Discord, Reddit, etc and then allow the software to automatically "wrap" their
message into multiple shorter lines to aid with reading the content.
<p>
Other platforms such as USENET, 2channel, and older BBS softwares expect posters to 
format their messages themselves, manually, generally setting a "per line" length
between 60 and 80 characters. This may be inconvenient compared to how newer
"apps" deal with message formatting, but it's not that bad.
<p>
If your line is too long, look at the error message to see where you need to break
up the line manually.

<h3>8. Should I know anything else about message length?</h3><p>
Yes: the subject / author fields are currently limited to 25 characters in length,
while the comment field is limited to several thousand characters in length.
Currently, long posts will simply be cut off when the message length limit is
exceeded. Don't post your novel here... when in doubt, post several shorter posts.
<p>
If you would rather be blocked from posting a too-long message than have a "cut up"
message be posted, say something in the meta thread.
