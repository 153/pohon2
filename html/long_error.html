<h3>long line error</h3>

We impose a limit on the length of lines in comments to
maintain a certain aesthetic on this platform. In the future, this
will likely be automated; at this time, we allow users to manually
resolve these issues themselves.
<p>
Currently, each line's maximum limit is set to {0} characters long
-- this is roughly the width of the text input box. When your
writing reaches the side of the textbox, please press the enter/return
key so that your long paragraphs are split over multiple lines.

Please see the lines that triggered this error message below.
